# Code Challenges

These are various programming exercises/katas, primarily from Leetcode.

While I don't find Leetcode to be a particularly insightful interviewing tool, the reality is that many companies use it so it helps to keep one's Leetcode-fu up to date.

Additionally, there is value for the programmer themselves in these problems. Typical "real-world" programming tasks tend to be CRUD-oriented. Leetcode problems give us a chance to keep our skills sharp when it comes to outdated concepts like "actually optimizing code" because Leetcode will tend to reject solutions that run in O(n^2) or worse time.
